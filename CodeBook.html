<h2>Getting and Cleaning Data</h2>

<h3>Peer Assessments</h3>

<h1>CodeBook</h1>

<p>##Data set and transformations 
This data set was obtained from different txt files (<a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip</a>).</p>

<p>To obtain a tidy data set, all the downloaded files were loaded and merged togheter to have a full data set with 563 columns and 10229 rows. 
The descriptive names of each activity (instead of numbers) were used to describe the 
activities properly. Then we considered only the variables with mean and 
standard deviation measurements in the names. The number 
of columns became 88. 
Finally an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
activity and each subject was created. The dimension of the final data set was 88 columns and 
180 rows. </p>

<h2>Steps to obtain the tidyDataset:</h2>

<h3>Loading</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download data</li>
<li>Read Data, Clean Features and use it to Rename Column Name</li>
<li>Read Features and Labels</li>
<li>Read Train Data</li>
<li>Read Test Data</li>
<li>Rename Column Name</li>
<li>Clean Features Data</li>
<li>Use features cleaned data to rename xTrain and xTest data columns</li>
</ul>

<h3>(1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set with (2.) only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement</h3>

<ul>
<li>Filter Features to have only Means and Standard deviations</li>
<li>And use filtered data to limit X dataset</li>
<li>Merge filtered data</li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Aggregate data by subjectId and activityDsc with Mean values</li>
</ul>

<h3>Write the Tidy dataset File</h3>

<h2>Interpretation of variables</h2>

<h3>In the name of variables are always present some of the following character or words:</h3>

<ul>
<li>X, Y, Z are the axis of X, Y and Z (X, Y and Z are the directions) </li>
<li>name that begin with t: time domain signals </li>
<li>name that begin with f: frequency domain signals </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;mean&rdquo;: Mean value </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;std&rdquo;: Standard deviation </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;Freq&rdquo;: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;angle&rdquo;: Angle between to vectors </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;Acc&rdquo;: Acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer (sensor signal). </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;Gyr&rdquo;: Angular velocity from the smartphone gyroscope (sensor signal). </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;Body&rdquo;: The signals related to the body of subject (individual) who has been examined. </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;Jerk&rdquo;: Jerk signals (the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to reach this signal) </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;Mag&rdquo;: magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm </li>
<li>name with &ldquo;Gravity&rdquo;: The signals related to the gravity. </li>
<li>subjectId: The numbers between 1 to 30 which are identifiers of the subjects 
(individuals) who carried out the experiment. </li>
<li>activitydsc: including 6 activities performed by subjects (STANDING, SITTING, 
LAYING, WALKING, WALKING-DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING-UPSTAIRS) </li>
</ul>
